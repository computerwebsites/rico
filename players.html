              <p>LeBron Raymone James is an American basketball player with the Los Angeles Lakers.
                 James first garnered national attention as the top high school basketball player in the country. With his unique combination of size, athleticism and court vision, he became a four-time NBA MVP. After leading the Miami Heat to titles in 2012 and 2013, James returned to
                Cleveland and helped the franchise claim its first championship in 2016.</p>

            <p>Born in 1989 in Los Angeles, California, basketball star James Harden is known as
              much for his prominent beard as he is for his stellar play. The No. 3 pick in the 2009
               NBA draft, he began his career with the Oklahoma City Thunder, before a stunning trade to the Houston Rockets in 2012. Harden has since emerged as a perennial MVP candidate, thanks in part to the sort of play that
              produced a record-setting 60-point triple-double in January 2018.</p>
